I didn't previously own an air fryer and recently did away with a secondary gas oven that I sometimes used when entertaining so I was looking for something to fill those needs.The air fryer functions took some time to get used to. I've found that telling Alexa to preheat the oven to 425 beforehand works well. This takes some time so I'll go about my business until the Echo announces that the oven is preheated, then place the food on the tray and rack into the oven and tell Alexa to air fry for x minutes at 425. I've cooked breaded shrimp and mozzarella sticks in it (10 mins) and breaded chicken patties (12 mins) and they've all come out sizzling hot and crispy.I've used the convection oven to heat frozen pizza with no issue, again the trick seems to be to preheat the oven before whatever you're planning on cooking, just as you would a conventional oven or fryer.The display temperature vacillates constantly during cooking as many have mentioned but it hasn't been an issue as I don't stand and watch my food cook and the end results seem to be just fine.The smart functions, as mentioned, need to be tweaked I think. Scanning the bar code inside the oven door did nothing but the oven paired to my network anyway so the scan idea seems to be pointless. Inevitably when I ask Alexa to preheat the oven it responds that \"the first oven door has been inactive for too long\" so I have to open and close the door before it consents. If I place food in the oven and ask Alexa to \"thaw one pound of ground beef\" it starts the microwave as expected and announces that it's cooking the beef so the microwave instructions/responses appear to be different from those used by the Amazon microwave which creates some confusion. Finally, the oven is factory set as \"first oven\" and although you can change the device name in the app it still insists on referring to the device as \"first oven\" which is generally annoying to me.While it certainly can use some tweaks and isn't something with the capacity to cook and feed a banquet it's pretty much what I had anticipated and works well for those purposes.", "summary": "Works as expected, smart functions need a bit of refining."},

I gave them a chance and when finished they were nothing more than just baked french fries that I could have done in my oven.OK Air Fryer isn't an actual Air Fryer so tried the microwave and warmer.  Those work as expected and its kind of cool that I can start the warmer from my couch when I want to eat.Haven't had a chance to try the auto roast yet, but will update.

I used the air fryer,  the function I was most excited to use. It worked well, once it got up to temperature but took too long to long to get there.  There was not enough air fryer pre settings.  For example,  chicken legs,  there was none.  So you had to estimate time based on other presets. I cooked 10 legs for about one hour,  30 minutes. That was after an initial cook time of 35 minutes. At the end of 35 minutes,  it was not even close at getting to temp of 425. There second cycle of 30 minutes finally reached 425, there about,  but did not finish the cook. I added the other 20 minutes or so,  and the cook was finally done. it was a fine cook with good flavor,  but took forever.  The Alexa integration when microwaving was easy to use and was the default function if asking to cook. Using Alexa for air frying was not good and again,  not enough item presets.  Good microwave. I'll try convection oven soon.  Hint from other reviews was to use convection oven to get up to temp,  425, then load items and use the air fryer settings.

Also, yes, you have to use Alexa to set the air fry temperature.  \"Alexa- air fry for X minutes at Y degrees\" will set the temperature for you.So far, I've used the microwave for a couple of things (I really only reheat coffee or sanitize a sponge with a microwave, so don't use it much) and have air fried a few items.  When air frying, I first preheat the oven to the target temperature, then air fry (I usually add some time to the recommended instructions if it's not a preset item- maybe 20% more time).
